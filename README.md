# Introduction

For this project, a custom designed PCB was created, made to be inserted into the headers of a development platform, such as an Arduino. The goal of the PCB is to provide a signal with an adjustable frequency and duty cycle, controllable with two potentiometers, to an input pin of an MCU.
